Welcome to the Knowledge Base of the "Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging" Protocol.
This repository contains standardized interface descriptions for aircraft cabin equipment.
Here, the aerospace industry collaborates to shape the cabin network of the future.

## Introduction

This repository complements the ARINC 853 "CSMIM" standard. ARINC 853 specifies a modern
communication protocol for non-essential cabin equipment. The protocol specification draws
from related standards in the building and home automation domain, including
[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) and [CBOR](https://cbor.io/) as building blocks. Whereas the
ARINC 853 document describes the generic protocol and data structure, this
repository -- the CSMIM Knowledge Base -- contains concrete interface definitions for
various cabin equipment. These definitions are considered "standard" and should be used
by all cabin equipment suppliers as far as possible.

The goal of our activities is to enable interoperability of all cabin equipment on all
types of aircraft, and to create an open aircraft cabin network where any supplier can
add new, useful functions.

## Organization and Contributing

This repository is owned by SAE ITC, the organization behind ARINC. The repository is managed
by the members of CSMIM working group, which belongs to the
[ARINC Cabin Systems Subcomittee](https://aviation-ia.sae-itc.com/subcommittees/cabin-systems-subcommittee).
Every ARINC member company can become active in the Cabin Systems Subcomitee and join the
CSMIM working group.

But you can contribute if you are not an ARINC member, too. Create an issue or join an existing
discussion to work towards standardizing your cabin equipment's CSMIM interfaces. Please
have a look at [our rules and process for contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md).
