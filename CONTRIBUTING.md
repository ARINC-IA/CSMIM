# How to contribute to CSMIM

Would you like to see an interface standardized as a CSMIM object type?
Or do you wish to enhance or change an existing type?

- **Search for existing CSMIM object types first** before requesting to
  create a new one.

- **Search the issues for existing discussions of your request.** Contribute
  to an existing discussion if possible, instead of opening a new issue.

- **Open an issue, describe your requirements and label it an enhancement.**
  If there are existing object types similar to what you need, mention them
  and explain what is missing for you and how the type should be enhanced.
  Note that we cannot change types once they are standardized, we can only
  replace them by newer types, with backwards-compatibility if possible.

Do you have a very concrete proposal for an object type?

- **Usually it is better to open an issue** and describe your requirements
  instead of directly proposing an object type YAML, because we will have to
  discuss the rationale of the object type's details in any case.

- **Fork this repository and add the YAML file specifying your object type.**
  Never edit an existing file &ndash; once standardized, an object type
  cannot be changed. Always create a new file, possibly with the same name
  and increased version number. **Then create a pull request.**

Thank you for your efforts that will help to improve the CSMIM standard!
